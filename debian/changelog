openipmi (2.0.29-0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergio Durigan Junior ]
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * d/watch: Update URL, since sf.net is giving a 404.
  * New upstream version 2.0.29. (Closes: #946059)
  * d/control: Add libreadline-dev to Build-Depends.
    The package doesn't use libedit anymore.
    Thanks to Christian Ehrhardt <christian.ehrhardt@canonical.com>
  * d/control: Bump debhelper to 13; use debhelper-compat.
  * d/rules: Disable the Python support.
    The Python support is now on by default, and historically we don't
    ship it, so just disable it.
    Thanks to Christian Ehrhardt <christian.ehrhardt@canonical.com>
  * d/rules: Adjust call to dh_install to use -a instead of -s.
    The "-s" option has been deprecated.
  * d/openipmi.init: Add check for systemd-udev.
    Even though udevadm and systemd-udev are distributed by the same
    package, it's a good idea to also check for the systemd-related udev
    binary, just in case.
    Thanks to Richard Laager <rlaager@wiktel.com> (Closes: #939739)
  * d/control: Bump Standards-Version to 4.5.
  * d/control: Add Vcs-* fields.
  * d/openipmi.init: Remove erroneous "$" prefix when printing a string.
    (Closes: #920461)
  * d/watch: Use QA's sf.net redirector.

  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * d/openipmi.init: fix various issues identified upstream (LP: #1844448)
    Debians and upstreams init file diverged a long time ago, so it is hard
    to fully unify them. But we can follow upstreams changes and apply it
    to d/openipmi.init.
